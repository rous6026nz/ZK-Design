	    For as long as I can remember art and illustrating has been a big part in my life &#151; and could draw for hours and hours on end.
	    As a child, drawing cartoon characters, transformers and dinosaurs was something I would do on a regular basis, and considered it a fun past &#150; time activity / hobby. From cars and animals, to fruit and landscapes, I would draw whatever caught my eye or interest.
	</p>
	<p>
	    As I got older, I became more observant of what was going on around me, and began critiquing different artists styles and use of different mediums for inspiration in my own work,
	    and developed an interest in contemporary art and the graffiti art movement.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Through my schooling years &#151; from primary through to High &#150; School, art and graphics were two subjects I was really interested in, and excelled in up until I left school. Both subject taught me key skills in both drawing and applying depth my work.
	    After leaving High &#150; School, I was at a crossroad in my life, and thought that there wasn't a career path for me in applying my illustration skills into real &#150; world employment, and decided to put down the pen, and pick up a shovel.
	</p>
	<p>
	    A few years past, and I was at the annual <span class="emphisis">&ldquo; Armageddon Expo &rdquo;</span> in Auckland, and came across a guy doing a demonstration of digital illustrations, using a computer and a wacom tablet.
	    I must have stood there chatting to this guy for around 30 minutes, when he asked me if I was interested and wanted to know more to visit their campus Natcoll on Karangahape Road, in Auckland CBD.
	</p>
	<p>
	    From that encounter, I am now a <span class="emphisis">qualified Computer Graphic Designer</span> and <span class="emphisis">Web Developer</span>, with the skillset and confidence to produce digital illustrations as a <span class="emphisis">profession</span>.
