        <p class="drop_caps">
            As you may have guessed, my name is <span class="emphisis">Zaine Kingi</span>, a Digital Media Designer based on the sunny Northshore of Auckland, New Zealand. A keen Illustrator&#44; Graphic Designer and Web Developer with the skill set and talent to
            produce high quality digital content, from print to web based. In my works I always try to combine aesthetic with functional aspects, looking for the right balance to communicate without annoying.
            <br/>
            Successful design in my opinion should be attractive yet easy to read, communicate a fascinating message, together with an immediate understanding.

        <p>I am the Head of the Web and Interactive Department at Natcoll. I worked with Zaine Kingi for 10 months as his tutor for the Diploma of Web Development program. Zaine demonstrated great commitment and talent during his course.</p>
        <p>Zaine is an independent learner, who works well both on his own and as a team member. He is able to assimilate many new skills and concepts very quickly. The high standards of his projects and excellent attention to detail are very good proof of his skills.</p>
        <p>Zaine has very strong work ethic. He has demonstrated great commitment to his tasks and the people around him. Zaine is friendily and approachable, which makes him a pleasure to work with.</p>

            <p>I am writting to support Zaine in this reference letter though deeply saddened to have him leave us. I would like to support Zaine as best I can, because of who he is as a person and what he has contributed.</p>
            <p>Zaine has been with Natcoll since 2010, a student of my Computer Graphic Design class. Zaine made a very positive contribution to the programme. He is talented and serious  about his work, he will be a great contribution to any positive work environment.</p>
            <p>It is with regret that he will leave us but I would be open to support and recommend him to any company or institution considering his application. He was a valuable asset to Natcoll throughout his time here. Zaine will be sincerely missed.</p>
