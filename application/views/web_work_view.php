	   A recently developed interest, Web Development was a path-way in which I never expected myself taking, let alone
	   persuing as a career. After completing the level 6 Diploma in Computer Graphic Design, I was faced with the challenge
	   of determining whether to enter the design industry, further my studies into the level 7 Diploma in Digital Media Advance
	   program or enroll in the level 6 Diploma in Web Development? Enjoying the little amount of exposure obtained during the
	   iCreate foundation course, I decided to enroll in Web Development.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Upon completion of the level 6 Diploma in Web Development, it became my prefered creative outlet and industry of work.
	    I enjoyed the versitility and accessability of working with the web, the fast pasted and ever changing nature of the internet
	    and the unlimited amount of knowledge available.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Valuable skills gained throughout the duration of the level 6 Diploma in Web Development included the ability to be adaptable
	    and learn new skills, preparation of professional documentation for real world clients and understanding the full scope and tasks
	    involved in pricing a client. I have the ability to pick up and learn new skills, concepts and programming languages fairly well,
	    and am able to incorprate these skills into all aspects of my work, not just Web.
