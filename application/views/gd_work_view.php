	    Graphic Design was the first pathway taken upon completion of the introductory foundation course held at Yoobee School of Design (formerly known as Natcoll). Prior to attending this foundation course,
	    my initial understanding of <span class="emphisis">Graphic Design</span> was something along the lines of fashion designing, and was an industry predominantly dominated by women, which at the time of
	    beginning the iCreate foundation course did not interest me.</p>
	<p>
	    With a background in illustration and graffiti art, attending a course which would help further develop my skills in illustration, so <span class="emphisis">3D Animation</span> was the initial
	    career pathway I planed to pursue, but later found I had developed an interest in <span class="emphisis">Computer Graphic Design</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Graduating the <span class="emphisis">Lvl.6 Diploma in Computer Graphic Design</span> has equipped me with a new skillset of tools to express my passion's in <span class="emphisis">digital media</span>.
	    From the Design Theory and Visualisation classes to the hands&#150;on learner of the computer's and design software.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The skills I've acquired throughout the duration of this course are indispensable, and
	    have opened up a vast array of possible career pathways in the ever&#150;changing and vibrant <span class="emphisis">design</span> industry.
